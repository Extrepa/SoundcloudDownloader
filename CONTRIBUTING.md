## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Before submitting a bug report, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:
1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Pull Requests
When creating your pull request, please include:

1. A clear and descriptive title.
2. A detailed description of the changes, including:
- The motivation for the changes.
- A summary of what has changed.
- Any potential side effects or areas that might be affected.
3. If applicable, include screenshots or animated GIFs demonstrating the changes.
4. Reference any related issues using the GitHub issue linking syntax (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456").

### Pull Request Process
1. A project maintainer will review your pull request.
2. They may ask for changes or clarifications in the comments.
3. Make any requested changes by pushing new commits to your branch. The PR will update automatically.
4. Once the maintainer is satisfied, they will approve and merge your pull request.

- Keep your pull requests focused on a single issue or feature. If you have multiple unrelated changes, submit them as separate pull requests.
- If your pull request is large or complex, consider breaking it into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Be responsive to comments and feedback on your pull request.
- Be patient. The maintainers are likely volunteers and may not be able to review your contribution immediately.
- If your pull request has conflicts with the base branch, rebase your branch onto the latest main branch.
